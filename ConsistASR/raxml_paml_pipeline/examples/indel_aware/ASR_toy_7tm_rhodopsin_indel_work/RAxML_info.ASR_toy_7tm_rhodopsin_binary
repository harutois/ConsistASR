IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences HeR_WP_100389406 and HeR_WP_066598408 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SzR_HDR73074 and SzR_TFH15433 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SzR_AM_5_00977 and SzR_TE_5S_00009 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file ASR_toy_7tm_rhodopsin_binary.phy.reduced

RAxML marginal ancestral state computation

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 44
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: BINARY/MORPHOLOGICAL
Substitution Matrix: Uncorrected
